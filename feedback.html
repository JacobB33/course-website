    <p>We want to make this course the best it can possibly be, and
    would be grateful for any suggestions, comments, and feedback you
    might have!</p>

    <p>The only request we have is that you keep your feedback constructive &ndash; saying something
    like "Lecture X was bad" isn't too helpful; saying something like "I found slides A, B, and C for lecture X confusing because..." is immensely helpful.</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://feedback.cs.washington.edu/">Link to anonymous feedback form</a></strong></p>

    <p>If you want to give feedback, but aren't sure what to say, here are some suggestions on things
    we'd like feedback about:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>How is the pace of the course? Too fast? Too slow?</li>
        <li>How is the homework? Too easy? Too difficult?</li>
        <li>How is lecture or section? Do you find the material interesting? Boring? Potentially
            interesting but presented in a boring way?</li>
        <li>Are there any supplemental resources you think we should create or write?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you want to leave a way to contact you in your feedback feel free to email us directly, make a private post on the discussion board, or just include your email in your submission to the anonymous feedback form.</p>
