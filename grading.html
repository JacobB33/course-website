<h3>Assignment Grading</h3>

<p>Here are some important clarifications about how grades will be assigned for
individual homework assignments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Correctness determinations will be based on the <b>intention</b> of
the problem. As long as we believe that the intention was clear, we will deduct
points from solutions that do not solve the intended problem. We will not
listen to legalistic arguments about why poor solutions should be considered
correct.</p></li>

<li><p>We may deduct points for other reasons than correctness:
<ul>
<li><p><b>Legibility</b>: We cannot give credit to solutions that cannot be
read. Furthermore, we will deduct points whenever the grader has to spend a
significant amount of time just trying to determine what the submission
says.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Clarity</b>: The goal of writing is to make the ideas clear to the
reader, so the grader will deduct points for solutions that are unclear to
them. (Note that we will not give points back just because the writing was
clear to the <i>writer</i>. It must be clear to reader, and only the reader can
say whether that was the case.)
</p></li>

<li><p><b>Style</b>: While it is generally better to err on the side of writing
too much rather than too litle in this class, we may deduct points for
solutions that are overly verbose or hard to follow.</p></li>
</ul>
</p></li>

<li><p>We will <b>not debate</b> the amount of points deducted for mistakes.
Those are at the descretion of the course staff.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Course Grading</h3>

<p>Overall percentage scores for the course will be determined roughly as
follows:
<table style="margin-left: 30px;">
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">4%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">Section Participation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">56%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">Homework (7% per assignment)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">15%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">Midterm exam</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">25%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">Final exam</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></p>

<p>However, since the homework and test problems we will give out in the course
have not been tried by students before, we feel the need to leave ourselves
room to adjust these weights based on how students perform. If an assignment
turns out to be much more difficult (or much easier) than expected, we would
want to decrease the weight on that assignment relative to others.</p>

<p>The final weighting for each assignment will be chosen when the grades for
that assignment are released. Likewise for the exams. Each student's overall
percentage will then be a weighted average using the weights chosen in that
manner rather than the fixed table of weights shown above (though we expect the
weights we choose will be very close to what is in the table).</p>

<p>Overall percentage scores will be translated into course grades as described
in the following table:
<table style="margin-left: 30px;">
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">96.5%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">4.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">94.5%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">3.9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">92.5%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">3.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">90.5%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">3.7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">88.5%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">3.6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">86.0%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">3.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">84.0%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">3.4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">82.0%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">3.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">80.0%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">3.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">78.0%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">3.1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">75.5%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">3.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">73.5%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">2.9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">71.5%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">2.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">69.5%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">2.7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">67.5%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">2.6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">65.0%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">2.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">63.0%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">2.4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">61.0%</td>
  <td style="padding: 0 5px">2.3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></p>

<p>Grades for scores below 60% will be determined by the instructors on a
case-by-case basis. (In particular, we reserve the right to pass students whose
percentages would fall below 2.0 if we continued the table above.)</p>

<p>As an example, an average of 90% on the homework assignments and 80% on
both the midterm and final exam would give an overall percentage score of
86.4%, using the tentative weights in the first table above. Per the second
table, that translates to a 3.5 grade as it is above 86.0% and below 88.5%. In
a similar manner, an average of 80% on the homework assignments and 70% on both
the midterm and final would would translate to a 3.0 grade, while an average of
70% on the the homework assignments and 60% on both exams would translate to a
2.5 grade.</p>

<p>As noted in the syllabus, most homework assignments will also include the
opportunity for extra credit. This will be incorporated into the grades, but
it will have only a tiny effect, meaning that it will only change grades that
are very close to a dividing line. Generally speaking, a student who completes
a reasonable amount of extra credit would expect to see an 85.9% score bumped
up to 86.0%, which would become a 3.5. However, in no circumstances will extra
credit increase a student's percentage score by more than 0.3%.</p>
