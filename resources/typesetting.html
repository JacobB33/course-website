<h2>Typesetting</h2>

<p>Students are <b>not required</b> to type their homework solutions. However,
solutions are required to be legible, and typesetting is one way to ensure that
they are easy to read. However, students should be warned that the software is
not always easy to use. In the past, some students have spent several hours
trying to make their solution look the way they want, which is neither
necessary nor advisable.</p>

<p><b>LaTeX</b> is the standard tool for typesetting mathematical materials.
While it takes some time to learn, it will likely pay for itself in the long
run. LaTeX math notation is also supported in some places outside of LaTeX
documents, such as on the message board.</p>

<p>A former CSE 311 instructor, Adam Blank, has provided these documents, which
may be useful:
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="https://www.countablethoughts.com/documents/homework-anon.tex">template</a> LaTeX file to use for CSE 311 homework assigments.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://www.countablethoughts.com/documents/HowToLaTeX.pdf">tutorial</a> on LaTeX, including specific information on how to use the template.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Note that LaTeX does not need to be installed on a local computer. You can
use it in a web browser at the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>
website.</p>

<p>Note that LaTeX is not the best tool for every job. In particular, for
drawing circuits, finite state machines, and other diagrams, it is often
preferable to draw them by hand, take a picture, and include it in the LaTeX
document using the <tt>\includegraphics{FILE_NAME}</tt> command. Furthermore,
as noted above, handwritten solutions are allowed for the other parts of
homework assignments as well, provided that the writing is easy to read.</p>
