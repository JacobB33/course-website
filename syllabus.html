<h3>Course Resources</h3>
<ol>
<p><li>Course website: <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse311/24su/">https://cs.washington.edu/311/24su</a>

<p><li>Gradescope, EdStem and other materials linked from the website above.
</ol>


<h3>Announcements</h3>

<p>You should regularly check the class web site and EdStem for announcements and other information,
including the most up-to-date information on problem sets and errata. The class web page will also have the
schedule of topics to be covered and links to other class materials, including 
slides (after lecture) etc. If you have any personal questions, please email the instructors directly. 
Any other non-sensitive questions about course content should be posted on our discussion forum. The discussion
forum also allows posting privately that are visible only to the course staff.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The goals of this course are to:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
  <li>Teach students the shared language of computer scientists.</li>

  <li>Give students a toolkit for solving difficult computational problems.</li>

  <li>Allow students to practice making and clearly communicating rigorous,
    formal arguments.</li>

  <li>Introduce students to theoretical computer science.</li>
</ul>


<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>The formal prequisites of this course are MATH 126 and CSE 123/143. Informally,
we will assume familiarity with basic mathematical objects like integers and
functions and with the basics of how computers perform calculations. For
example, we will assume students are familiar with how non-negative integers
can be written in binary.</p>


<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Course Structure</h3>

<h4>Topics</h4>

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The course content can be grouped into three
  parts:</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <li><b>Logic and Proofs</b>: how to make and communicate rigorous, formal
      arguments (and how to specify logic circuits)</li>

  <li><b>Applications of Logic</b>: understanding mathematical objects that are
      widely used in computer science such as numbers, sets, relations, and
      recursively-defined data and functions</li>

  <li><b>Theoretical Computer Science</b>: different models of computation and
      what problems they can solve</li>
</ol>

<h3>Textbook</h3>

<p>There is no required text for the course. For the first 6-7 weeks of the
course, the following textbook can be useful: Rosen, Discrete Mathematics and
Its Applications, McGraw-Hill. It should be available through the bookstore 
and on short-term loan from the Engineering Library.</p>

<p>On occasion, there may be required readings during the course when there is
insufficient time to fully cover the material during lecture. If this occurs,
the readings will be posted on the web site and students will be notified of
the reading via email or the message board.</p>

<h3>Lectures</h3>

<p>Lectures will be given in person, at the locations and times shown on the
time schedule.  They will be recorded for later review but this ability should 
not be used to substitute for in-class attendance.   Experience 
with prior classes has shown that there is a strong correlation between
attendance in class and overall course grades.
</p>

<h3>Sections</h3>

<p>Each week includes a TA-led quiz section. These will not be recorded, but
the printed material used will be posted on the section list and calendar.</p>

<p>Each quiz section will be focused on preparation for the next homework
assignment. A substantial portion of the time will be spent on practice
problems similar to those appearing in that homework. It is very important that
students take the time to work through the practice problems before attempting
the homework, not only to make sure they understand how to solve them but also
to understand how to communicate their solution in writing in a way that will
be clear enough to receive full credit.</p>

<p>
  Past experience indicates that section attendance is extremely important for being successful 
  in the course. For that reason, <b>participation in section</b> will be included as part of the 
  course grade. Those who are sick or otherwise unable to attend can complete the practice 
  problems on their own and submit their solutions in Gradescope by 5pm on Thursday.


</p>


<h3>Course Grades</h3>

Your final course grade will be computed according to the following rough 
breakdown:
<p><br>
<table>
<tr><td width="30pt"> <td>Problem Sets (8)</td><td width="10pt"></td><td align="right">45-50 %</td></tr>
<tr><td></td> <td>Midterm</td><td></td><td align="right">15-20 %</td></tr>
<tr><td></td> <td>Final Exam</td><td></td><td align="right">30-35 %</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Quiz Section Participation</td><td></td><td align="right">~5%</td></tr>
</table>


<h3> Problem Sets</h3>


<ul>
    <p><li>There will be 8 homework problem sets, to be solved <i>individually</i>.

	    <p><li>
Students will receive an email invitation, during the first week of the
course, to a course web page in GradeScope, where they can submit their
homework solutions. To do so, they will first need to scan their solutions into
a PDF. Portions of the scans that are not readble by the TAs (either due to the
quality of the scan or the legibility of the handwriting) cannot be graded or
receive credit.</p>

<p><li>Potentially some of the problem sets will also involve submission through tools via another website that
will let you practice with the course concepts directly and will act both as an 
assistant and autograder.

<p><li>Problem Sets will generally be due on Fridays with some execptions.

<p><li> You <i>must</i> show your work; Ideally as much as you
would need to explain to a fellow classmate who had not solved the problem before. 
A correct answer with no work is worth nothing, less than a wrong answer with sufficient explanations explaining your reasoning.


<p><li> You must tag the question parts of your homework correctly on 
Gradescope. Failure to do so can
result in a 0 on every untagged question. 
Please check your submission by clicking each question,
and making sure your solution appears there.
<p><li> You do not need to solve all problem sets to secure the highest possible grade. If you are unable to finish a problem, turning in 
  what you have will likely give you a lot of partial credit


<p><li> Students are encouraged to help each other learn the course material.
However, we must disallow collaboration that aims to <i>avoid</i> learning
(a.k.a. "cheating").</p>
It is okay, and indeed <i>encouraged</i>, to discuss homework problems with other students, but this is subject to strict constraints:
<ul>
  <li>You must list, on their submission, the name of everyone you worked
    with.</li>
  <li>You must <b>write up all solutions on your own, unassisted</b>.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>When working on solutions with others, we <u>require</u> that:
<ul>
  <li>You do not leave with any part of the solution in writing or photographs
    (only in their head).</li>
  <li>You wait at least 30 minutes before writing your own solution.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Since you cannot list "The Internet" as one of their collaborators,
students may not consult the Internet for problems or key-phrases. This
includes Google, MathOverflow, reddit, and any other website. However, students
may consult the internet for ideas, definitions, and understanding general
concepts. Googling resources about problems is allowed, but Googling problems 
themselves are not allowed</p>

<p>Each student should keep their own solution (the one they plan to or have
submitted) <b>private</b> until after the assignment due date. <u>Under no
circumstances</u> should they give a copy of their solution to another
student, as that would clearly violate the rules listed above.</p>

<p> You must be able to explain your answer if asked to do so. We may do some spot checks in which we ask students to explain one of their solutions
(or solve a slight variant of the problem they solved on the homework) in person. 




<p>
<h4>Extra Credit</h4>

<p>Homework assignments will sometimes have extra credit problems. They will be
scored separately from the regular problems, and they will have
<b>little to no impact</b> on course grades. The main incentive for doing the
extra credit problems is for the additional challenge.</p>

<h4>Typesetting</h4>

<p>Students are <b>not required</b> to type their homework solutions. However,
solutions are required to be legible, and typesetting is one way to ensure that
they are easy to read. In future courses typesetting might be required so 311 gives a great
oportunity to practice it now</p>

<p>Students who would like to try typing their solutions  (especially useful
  if you take other classes that involve a fair amount of math or plan to write
  research papers) can see the <a href="resources.php">resources</a> page for advice on how to
do so. However, students should be warned that the software is not always easy
to use. </p>

<h4>Late Policy</h4>

<ul>
<p><li> Problem Sets: For this course, we will be trying a new method where if you need to turn in a homework
  late, there is a form linked on the main page to request late days. You <b>MUST</b> fill this out before the 
  assignment is due, but requests will be automatically approved. We do not anticipate students needing to use more than 2
  or 3 late days for the entire quarter, so if it becomes regular, we will reach out and offer support to help with finishing
  assignments on time. We reserve the right to prevent people from requesting late days if they make regular requests. 

<p> <li> For any special circumstances that require more than 2 late days, email the instructor to have your request considered
  on a case by case basis.

<p><li> The final problem set will not be accepted late.
</ul>
<h4> Homework Regrades</h4>

<p>If grading mistakes occur, regrade requests are due on Gradescope within
<i>one week</i> of grades being published (with <i>no exceptions</i>).
While regrades can (and should) be used to fix mistakes where a correct
solution is mistakenly marked incorrect, they cannot (and should not) be used
to request changes to amounts of points deducted for errors. Deductions are
applied consistently to all students. We will not give one student a smaller
deduction than others who made the same (or very similar) mistakes, so do not
ask us to do so.


<h4>Getting Help</h4>

<p>Each member of the course staff will have at least one office hour every
week, where students can get one-on-one help. See the staff page
<a href="staff.html">Course Staff Page</a> for times and
locations.</p>

<p>Students can also ask questions at any time on the message board. During
normal working hours, they should receive a response within a fairly short
period of time.</p>

<p>We will also have 1 on 1 meetings that you can have with TAs in order 
  to help with concepts or past homeworks
</p>

<h3>Exams</h3>
<ul>
<li />There will be a midterm and final in this course to act as culminating assessments of the course concepts. 
These exams will be required to be taken <i>in person</i>. 
<li /> The midterm will be in class during your regular lecture time on
<b>July 19th</b>.
<li />
The final exam will be given over a 2 hour period Friday August 16th from 3:30-5:30 in room TBD.

<li /> If you are unable to make these exam times, reach out as soon as possible to the instructor to work
out potential make up exam times.
</ul>



<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Policies</h3>

<h4>Inclusiveness</h4>

<p>Students should expect and demand to be treated with respect by their
classmates and the course staff. All students belong here, and the staff is
here to help them learn and enjoy a challenging course. If any incident occurs
that challenges this commitment to a supportive and inclusive environment,
students should please let the staff know so the issue can be addressed.</p>

<h4>Academic Integrity</h4>

<p>As noted above, even when students work together to initially solve a
problem, we expect each student to write their own solution, independently and
unassisted. Attempting to misrepresent another student's solution as their own
would be unfair to the other students in the course and constitute academic
misconduct in violation of the
<a href="/academics/misconduct">Allen School policy</a>. Any such violation
will be reported to University.</p>

<p>If a student is ever unclear about whether their collaboration went over the
line, they should (a) ask and (b) describe their collaboration clearly on their
assignment. If they do, the worst that will happen is losing some points. That
is much better than the alternative.</p>


<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<ul>
<p><li>   Disability Accommodation Policy: See <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/current-students/accommodations/">here</a> for the current policy.
<p><li>   Religious Accommodation Policy: See <a href="https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy">here</a> for the current policy.
</ul>





<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Advice For Students</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><i>Start each homework assignment early.</i> As noted above, it is hard
to know how long any assignment will take you, so you need to leave time
available in case the problems are more difficult than you expected. We
strongly encourage you to consider a schedule of completing one problem a day,
rather than all the problems in one or two days.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Prefer the message board to office hours.</i> Office hours get very
busy, especially in the last 48 hours before assignments are due. (Yet another
reason to start early is that you can attend office hours that are less busy.) 
Even just before assignments are due, however, questions on the message board
are usually answered within a short period of time.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Do not skip class to work on homework</i>, not even late in the
quarter when you are more tired and busy. Doing so often seems like it will
save you time in the short run, but it will cost you time (and learning) in the
long run.</li>

<li><p><i>Remember that your grade in this course matters much less than how
much you learn.</i> Your success in future classes (and job interviews) will
depend on how well you learned the topics we cover, not what grade you
received. (Employers, in particular, do not care that your instructors say, via
your grade, that you learned the material. They want to see you demonstrate
your knowledge directly in the interview.)</p></li>
