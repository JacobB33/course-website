<h2>Syllabus</h2>

<p>Students are expected to be familiar with all of the information below.
They should read it fully and carefully. 

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The goals of this course are to:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 5px;">
  <li>Teach students the shared language of computer scientists.</li>

  <li>Give students a toolkit for solving difficult computational problems.</li>

  <li>Allow students to practice making and clearly communicating rigorous,
    formal arguments.</li>

  <li>Introduce students to theoretical computer science.</li>
</ul>


<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>The formal prequisites of this course are MATH 126 and CSE 123/143. Informally,
we will assume familiarity with basic mathematical objects like integers and
functions and with the basics of how computers perform calculations. For
example, we will assume students are familiar with how non-negative integers
can be written in binary.</p>

<p><u>For students who are unsure of their preparation for the course in any way</u>: You are
<b>strongly encouraged</b> to take CSE 390z concurrently with CSE 311.</p>


<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Course Structure</h3>

<h4>Topics</h4>

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The course content can be grouped into three
  parts:</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <li><b>Logic and Proofs</b>: how to make and communicate rigorous, formal
      arguments (and how to specify logic circuits)</li>

  <li><b>Applications of Logic</b>: understanding mathematical objects that are
      widely used in computer science such as numbers, sets, relations, and
      recursively-defined data and functions</li>

  <li><b>Theoretical Computer Science</b>: different models of computation and
      what problems they can solve</li>
</ol>

<h4>Textbook</h4>

<p>There is no required text for the course. For the first 6-7 weeks of the
course, the following textbook can be useful: Rosen, Discrete Mathematics and
Its Applications, McGraw-Hill. (Course materials will reference problem numbers
from the 8th edition, but older versions largely include the same material.) It
should be available through the bookstore and on short-term loan from the
Engineering Library.</p>

<p>On occasion, there may be required readings during the course when there is
insufficient time to fully cover the material during lecture. If this occurs,
the readings will be posted on the web site and students will be notified of
the reading via email or the message board.</p>

<h4>Lectures</h4>

<p>Lectures will be given in person, at the locations and times shown on the
time schedule.  They will be recorded for later review but this ability should 
not be used to substitute for in-class attendance.   Experience 
with prior classes has shown that there is a strong correlation between
attendance in class and overall course grades.
</p>

<h4>Sections</h4>

<p>Each week includes a TA-led quiz section. These will not be recorded, but
the printed material used will be posted on the section list and calendar.</p>

<p>Each quiz section will be focused on preparation for the next homework
assignment. A substantial portion of the time will be spent on practice
problems similar to those appearing in that homework. It is very important that
students take the time to work through the practice problems before attempting
the homework, not only to make sure they understand how to solve them but also
to understand how to communicate their solution in writing in a way that will
be clear enough to receive full credit.</p>


<h4>Exams</h4>

<p>There will be a midterm exam held in class and a final exam during finals
week.</p>

<p>Note that the final exam <u><b>will not</b> be at the time and place listed
in the UW time schedule</u>. The final exam for Section A is as listed, but
the final exam for Section A is not. Instead, Section A will have its exam
immediately after Section B's, in the same room. These times and locations are
shown correctly on the <a href="calendar/calendar.html">course calendar</a>.
</p>


<h4>Homework</h4>

<p>Homework will consist of 8 assignments, normally with one due each week
(except for the week of the midterm).  As noted above, each quiz section will
include practice problems similar to those on that week's homework
assignment.</p>

<h4>Extra Credit</h4>

<p>Homework assignments will often have extra credit problems. They will be
scored separately from the regular problems, and they will have
<b>little to no impact</b> on course grades. The main incentive for doing the
extra credit problems is for the additional challenge.</p>

<h4>Getting Help</h4>

<p>Each member of the course staff will have at least one office hour every
week, where students can get one-on-one help. See the
<a href="calendar/calendar.html">course calendar</a> for times and
locations.</p>

<p>Students can also ask questions at any time on the message board. During
normal working hours, they should receive a response within a fairly short
period of time (certainly under an hour).</p>


<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Mechanics</h3>

<h4>Communication</h4>

<p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
In addition to in-person discussion, students and staff will communicate
through the following online means:
</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <li><b>Course Mailing List</b>: for the instructors to email the class with
    infrequent but important announcements. (All students are auto-subscribed,
    but students should be sure to check their @uw email for these emails.)</li>

  <li><b>Ed Message Board</b> (<a href="ed-todo">link</a>): the preferred way
    to ask questions about course content and homework assignments</li>

  <li><b>Staff Mailing List</b> (cse311-staff at cs): for private matters, not
    suitable to the message board</li>
</ul>

<h4>Typesetting</h4>

<p>Students are <b>not required</b> to type their homework solutions. However,
solutions are required to be legible, and typesetting is one way to ensure that
they are easy to read.</p>

<p>Students who would like to try typing their solutions can see the
<a href="resources/typesetting.html">typesetting</a> page for advice on how to
do so. However, students should be warned that the software is not always easy
to use. In the past, some students have spent several hours trying to make
their solution look the way they want, which is neither necessary nor
advisable.</p>


<h4>Homework Submission</h4>

<p>Students will receive an email invitation, during the first week of the
course, to a course web page in GradeScope, where they can submit their
homework solutions. To do so, they will first need to scan their solutions into
a PDF. Portions of the scans that are not readble by the TAs (either due to the
quality of the scan or the legibility of the handwriting) cannot be graded or
receive credit.</p>

<h4>Homework Regrades</h4>

<p>If grading mistakes occur, students are encouraged to bring them to the
attention of the course staff and see that they are corrected. They can do so
by requesting a regrade in GradeScope, with the following caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We will only entertain regrade requests for <b>one week</b> after the
grades are initially are posted. In particular, students searching for extra
points late in the quarter by requesting regrades of problems from early
assignments will be ignored.</p></li>

<li><p>While regrades can (and should) be used to fix mistakes where a correct
solution is mistakenly marked incorrect, they cannot (and should not) be used
to request changes to amounts of points deducted for errors. Deductions are
applied consistently to all students. We will not give one student a smaller
deduction than others who made the same (or very similar) mistakes, so do not
ask us to do so.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Policies</h3>

<h4>Inclusiveness</h4>

<p>Students should expect and demand to be treated with respect by their
classmates and the course staff. All students belong here, and the staff is
here to help them learn and enjoy a challenging course. If any incident occurs
that challenges this commitment to a supportive and inclusive environment,
students should please let the staff know so the issue can be addressed.</p>

<h4>Grading</h4>


<h4>Late Policy</h4>

<p>Homework assignments are designed to be completed by the due dates listed.
Situations may arise, however, where students are unable to complete the
assignment by those dates. For that reason, we will allow students to
submit assignments <i>one day late</i> with no penalty, provided that the
following conditions are met:

<ul>
<li><p>Students use <b>no more than <b><i>one</i></b> late day per
assignment.</b> A &ldquo;day&rdquo; means 24 hours from the original due
date/time.</p></li>

<li><p>Students use <b>no more than two late days</b> total during the
quarter.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Late work not meeting these conditions (i.e., more than 24 hours on one
assignment or more than two assignments) will only be accepted after a
discussion with course instructors.</p>

<p>Students do not need to take any special action when submitting an
assignment late. The course staff will note the late submission and keep track
of how many late submissions have occurred.</p>

<p>In addition, please note that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Anything more than a few minutes late is just as late as something
submitted the next day.</p></li>

<li><p>Finishing an assignment one date late means a student has one fewer day
to complete the next assignment.</p></li>

<li><p>Late days are intended to cover any emergencies that arise. We do not
grant extra late days beyond the first two just for emergencies &mdash; those
two are intended to cover emergencies.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Collaboration</h4>

<p>Students are encouraged to help each other learn the course material.
However, we must disallow collaboration that aims to <i>avoid</i> learning
(a.k.a. "cheating").</p>

<p>With that in mind, students are <b>encouraged to work together</b> on
homework problems subject to the following constraints:
<ul>
  <li>They must list, on their submission, the name of everyone they worked
    with.</li>
  <li>They must <b>write up all solutions on their own, unassisted</b>.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>When working on solutions with others, we <u>require</u> that:
<ul>
  <li>They do not leave with any part of the solution in writing or photographs
    (only in their head).</li>
  <li>They wait at least 30 minutes before writing their own solution.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Since they cannot list "The Internet" as one of their collaborators,
students may not consult the Internet for problems or key-phrases. This
includes Google, MathOverflow, reddit, and any other website. However, students
may consult the internet for ideas, definitions, and understanding general
concepts.</p>

<p>Each student should keep their own solution (the one they plan to or have
submitted) <b>private</b> until after the assignment due date. <u>Under no
circumstances</u> should they give a copy of their solution to another
student, as that would clearly violate the rules listed above.</p>

<h4>Academic Integrity</h4>

<p>As noted above, even when students work together to initially solve a
problem, we expect each student to write their own solution, independently and
unassisted. Attempting to misrepresent another student's solution as their own
would be unfair to the other students in the course and constitute academic
misconduct in violation of the
<a href="/academics/misconduct">Allen School policy</a>. Any such violation
will be reported to University, and the instructors will make every attempt to
ensure the harshest allowable penalty.</p>

<p>If a student is ever unclear about whether their collaboration went over the
line, they should (a) ask and (b) describe their collaboration clearly on their
assignment. If they do, the worst that will happen is losing some points. That
is much better than the alternative.</p>

<h4>Accommodations</h4>

<p>Please refer to university policies regarding
<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/current-students/accommodations/">
disability accommodations</a> and
<a href="https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-polic/"> religious accommodations</a>.</p>


<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Advice For Students</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><i>Start each homework assignment early.</i> As noted above, it is hard
to know how long any assignment will take you, so you need to leave time
available in case the problems are more difficult than you expected. We
strongly encourage you to consider a schedule of completing one problem a day,
rather than all the problems in one or two days.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Prefer the message board to office hours.</i> Office hours get very
busy, especially in the last 48 hours before assignments are due. (Yet another
reason to start early is that you can attend office hours that are less busy.) 
Even just before assignments are due, however, questions on the message board
are usually answered within a short period of time.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Do not skip class to work on homework</i>, not even late in the
quarter when you are more tired and busy. Doing so often seems like it will
save you time in the short run, but it will cost you time (and learning) in the
long run.</li>

<li><p><i>Remember that your grade in this course matters much less than how
much you learn.</i> Your success in future classes (and job interviews) will
depend on how well you learned the topics we cover, not what grade you
received. (Employers, in particular, do not care that your instructors say, via
your grade, that you learned the material. They want to see you demonstrate
your knowledge directly in the interview.)</p></li>

<li><p><i>Remember that making mistakes is part of learning.</i> The only
people who do not make mistakes are those who don't try new things. People who
push themselves to do new things make mistakes all the time, even if you don't
notice them. As Kevin Kelly said, &quot;professionals are just amateurs who
recover gracefully from their mistakes.&quot;</p></li>

<li><p><i>Try to find the parts of computer science that excite you</i>. To
quote Kevin Kelly again, &quot;being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ
points&quot;.</p></li>
